Welcome to Chryalisp textedit.

This editor has basic text editing functionality. It allows
editing multiple buffers. Switching to another open buffer
is fairly primitiveâ€”using the arrow buttons.

Save files to your user account by typing:
apps/login/<username>. If you've not created an account the
username will be Guest.

Save and open use the same textbox. As it stands, you can
open a file with any name and it will touch, then open the
file. No need to New a file, then Save it if you know you 
want it saved to disk in the first place. New buffers exist
only in memory until manually saved to disk.

WARNING: If you save a system file to it's
own location, you're making changes to the system as it's
running. Make sure this is what you want to do or you may 
break your system.
