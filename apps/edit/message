Welcome to ChrysaLisp edit
==========================

Edit has the most basic of functionality, as you can see. 

Opening a buffer using the textbox, or creating a new buffer
doesn't close the buffer you were previously on. You may
create a new buffer by clicking "+". Then come back here by
clicking "<". 

Buffers are saved and closed explicitly. Closing the last
buffer closes the edit window. Any changes that have not
been saved will be lost! 

New files aren't stored anywhere until they are saved. To
save enter a path and click the save icon.

If you want a new buffer to be saved when you create it,
enter a path. Then, click the open icon. Opening a buffer
at a path that doesn't exists, creates  the buffer at that
path.

If there are no "/" characters in the textbox when you open
or save, the events will occur within your user directory.
The default user is Guest.

To test things out and to see some basic configuration
options, first open a new buffer with "+", then type 
"pupa.inc" then click the open icon.

You can remove this file from the *env_edit_auto* list, and
edit will start with an empty buffer.
