Welcome to ChrysaLisp edit
==========================

Edit has standard buttons for opening, saving, closing, and
creating buffers, as well as navigating through them.

On the right side of the screen are buttons to clear the
textfield, search, and scroll through search results.

Between these sets of buttons is a textfield. It is used
to enter search terms and may be used to issue commands.

The following is a list commands recognized
by edit:

(open:<path>) If path is already opened, it will switch
to that buffer. If it doesn't exist, it will create a new
buffer there, otherwise it will open an existing file.

(save:<path>) Save the current buffer to the given path.

(new) create a new untitled buffer.

(close) close the current buffer, this will close the
application if you close the last buffer.

(prev) and (next) navigate open buffers

(find:<string>) is usually unnecessary, unless searching
for a string that is also an edit command.

To navigate found strings, press enter to move down the
search results, or use the find navigation buttons.

Confirmation is required for saving to overwrite an existing
file or to create a new file in the filesystem. Files
created using the (new) command,  aren't stored to the
filesyste until a save command is issued..

To prevent this  message from appearing when opening edit,
remove apps/edit/message from *env_edit_auto* in the 
pupa.inc file at apps/login/<username>/pupa.inc.
 
To do so issue the command:
(open:apps/login/Guest/pupa.inc)
