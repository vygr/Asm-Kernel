Welcome to ChrysaLisp edit
==========================

Edit has standard bufttons for opening, saving, closing,
and creating buffers, as well as navigating through them.

There are three bars at the top of edit view. The nav bar,
the tab bar, and the status bar.

The nav bar has open and save buttons, and a textfield.
Within the textfield are four buttons: the find button on 
the left, and the clear, previous, and next result buttons
on the right.

Left and right buttons are used to undo and redo edits. Up
and down arrows scroll through previously issued commands.

The following list of commands is recognized by edit:

(open:<path>) If path is already opened, it will switch
to that buffer. If it doesn't exist, it will create a new
buffer there, otherwise it will open an existing file.

(save:<path>) Save the current buffer to the given path.

(new) create a new untitled buffer.

(close) Close the current buffer. This will close edit, if
closing the last open buffer.

(prev) and (next) navigate open buffers.

(find:<string>) Search for <string> within the buffer.
The command is usually unnecessary, as any string that
isn't an edit command is considered a search string.

To navigate found strings, press enter or use the left and
right buttons within the textfield.

To prevent this message from appearing when opening edit,
remove apps/edit/message from *env_edit_auto* in the 
pupa.inc file at apps/login/<username>/pupa.inc.
 
To do so use the open file dialog box, or issue the command 
(open:apps/login/Guest/pupa.inc) in the textfield. Then,
edit the file, and either use the save dialog box or issue
the (save) command in the textfield.
