Welcome to ChrysaLisp edit
==========================

Edit has standard buttons for opening, saving, closing,
and creating buffers, as well as navigating through them.
It is also capable of running applications using the
play button, entering a command into the textfield, or
from the menu.

When entering commands into the textfield, <path> should
be entered without quotations. The following list of 
commands can be entered into the textfield:

(open) or (open:<path>) 

(save) or (save:<path>)

(new)

(run) or (run:<path>) run a ChrysaLisp application.

(close)

(prev) and (next) for navigating buffers

(find:<string>) This command isn't generally necessary, as
anything that isn't a command will begin a search for the
given string.

To navigate found strings, press enter or use the up and
down arrows within the textfield.

To prevent this message from appearing when opening edit,
remove apps/edit/message from *env_edit_auto* in the 
pupa.inc file at apps/login/<username>/pupa.inc.
 
To do so use the open file dialog box or command 
(open:apps/login/Guest/pupa.inc). Edit the file, then use
the save dialog box or (save) command.
