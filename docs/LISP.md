# Lisp

It's probably worth a few words specifically about the included Lisp and how it
works, and how many rules it breaks ! The reason for doing the Lisp was to
allow me to create an assembler to replace NASM, I was not concerned with
sticking to 'the lisp way', or whatever your local Lisp guru says. No doubt I
will have many demons in hell awaiting me...

First of all there is no garbage collector by choice. All objects used by the
Lisp are reference counted objects from the class library. Early on the Lisp
was never going to have a problem with cycles because it had no way to create
them, but as I developed the assembler I decided to introduce two functions,
`push` and `elem-set`, that could create cycles. However the efficiency
advantage in coding the assembler made me look the other way. There are now
other ways that a cycle can be created, by naming an environment within its own
scope, but again this was too good an efficiency feature to miss out on. So you
do have to be careful not to create cycles, so think about how your code works.

No tail recursion optimization ! There is a single looping function provided in
native code, `while`, every other looping construct builds on this primitive.
There are also two native primitives `some!` and `each!` that provide generic
access to iterating over a slice of a sequence/s, while calling a function on
the grouped elements. Standard `some` and `each` are built on these but they
also allow other constructs to be built and gain the advantage of machine coded
iteration. I try to stick to a functional approach in my Lisp code, and
manipulate collections of things in a functional way with operations like
`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `each` etc. I've not found the lack of tail
recursion a problem.

All symbols live in the same environment, functions, macros, everything. The
environment is a chain of hash maps. Each lambda gets a new hash map pushed
onto the environment chain on invocation, and dereferenced on exit. The `env`
function can be used to return the current hash map and optionally resize the
number of buckets from the default of 1. This proves very effective for storing
large numbers of symbols and objects for the assembler as well as creating
caches. Make sure to `setq` the symbol you bind to the result of `env` to `nil`
before returning from the function if you do this, else you will create a cycle
that can't be freed.

`defq` and `bind` always create entries in the top environment hash map. `setq`
searches the environment chain to find an existing entry and sets that entry or
fails with an error. This means `setq` can be used to write to symbols outside
the scope of the current function. Some people don't like this, but used wisely
it can be very powerful. Coming from an assembler background I prefer to have
all the guns and knives available, so try not to shoot your foot off.

There is no cons, cdr or car stuff. Lists are just vector objects and you use
`push`, `cat`, `slice` etc to manipulate elements. Also an empty list does not
evaluate to `nil`, it's just an error.

Function and macro definitions are scoped and visible only within the scope of
the declaring function. There is no global macro list. During macro expansion
the environment chain is searched to see if a macro exists.
